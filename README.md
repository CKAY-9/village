# Village

A Werewolf inspired deduction gamemode in Minecraft.

## What is Village?

Village is a Minecraft server plugin that introduces a new gamemode based off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Werewolf</a>, a deduction game similar to Among Us.

## How does it work?

If you have ever played Werewolf, Mafia, Among Us, etc., the game loop is pretty similar. There is two opposing sides: Villagers and Mobs. The Villagers have to work together to find out who the Mobs are, and get them evicted. Individual Villagers can have a unique role (e.g. medic or detective) that give them buffs; however, Mobs are also able to have special abilities (e.g. cleaning up bodies, placing traps, etc.).

## How do I play Village?

All you need to do is download the latest release of the Village plugin (something like `village-1.x.x.jar`) and then placing it in your Spigot/Paper server's `/plugins` folder.

Once in-game, you are able to setup vents, a spawn and meeting location, and others. This allows you to create your own maps.

After everything is setup, you can get your friends together and play (or play by yourself, that's how I test it);

### TASKS?!

Similar to Among Us, Village does have tasks for the Villagers to do; however, these are not meant to be a win-condition and are pretty simple. Currently, if the Villagers finish all their tasks, they are given compasses that point towards the Mobs.

There are currently three different types of tasks: math (simple equations you need to answer correctly in a time limit), craft (given materials and must craft a specific item), trivia (both general and Minecraft related), and custom (you are able to create your own questions/answers).
